				<div class="flex-row">
					<p>Mexcio’s water crisis has been a prevalent issue for a long time, Mexico’s Government released an advertising campaign in 2010 titled “The City My Run Out of Water” and this statement still holds true. Even though Mexico has an abundance of rainwater this resource is not properly utilized. 70% of the city’s water source comes from aquifers that are not able to reliably refill compared to its depletion, due to rainwater being stopped by asphalt and concrete. <br><span class="blue_tekst">Source: <a href="https://penniur.upenn.edu/uploads/media/02_Gutierrez.pdf">https://penniur.upenn.edu</a></span>

				<h3 class="underoverskrift">India's Water Crisis</h3>
				<div class="flex-row">
					<p>In India the people have to line up daily to receive their most basic resource, water. This is supplied to them by the government, but sometimes this is not enough either. As India is already one of the most populated countries in the world and only growing larger, it is outgrowing its water supply. In certain large cities the reservoirs that provide them water are nearly dry. About 80 to 90% of India’s water comes from groundwater resources, which is simply not enough. However in the monsoon season of India, they receive a lot of rainfall and if this is used and harvested effectively their problems may be a thing of the past. <br> <span class="blue_tekst">Source: <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/27/india/india-water-crisis-intl-hnk/index.html">https://edition.cnn.com</a></span></p>
